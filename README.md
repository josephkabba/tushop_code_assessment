# Environment

- The source code is written in Python 3.11.5.
- The execution platform used was Fedora (Linux).
- No external or standard libraries were used in the implementation of this work.

# Execution

1. Download and install Python 3.11.5 or any Python 3.x version.
2. In your terminal, execute the Python script by typing:

    ```
    python3 [file_name].py
    ```

3. When running the `goodie.py` script, just enter:

    ```
    python3 goodie.py
    ```

    That is all.

4. When running the `jobs.py` script, you'll need to enter data in the following format:

    - Enter the number of Jobs: n as an interger between 0 and 10.
    - For each job:
      - Enter start date, end date and profit in that order.
      - You will be guided by the script when running it.
      - entering the jobs is a for loop of n jobs.

# Sample Data for `jobs.py`

```terminal
Enter the number of Jobs: 3
Enter job start time, end time, and earnings

Start date: 0900
End date: 1030
Profit: 100

Start date: 1000

Start date: 1100
End date: 1200

```
